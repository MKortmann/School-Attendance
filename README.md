# school-attendance

School Attendance has a visual interface to track the number of attendance of each student!

## Basic 

This project consist in get a really mess code and improve it.
The code was improved using the method MVO (Model, View, Octopus).


## Some Explanation

  - View: everything that the user sees and interacts with it. 
    It includes: DOM elements, input elements, buttons, and images.

  - Model: is where the data is stored! That includes data from the server
    and from the user. A simple example of a model is an object that store variable and arrays.
    Now, the model and the view are connected, specifically by our octopus.

  - The octupus provides the separations of concerns that we desperately need
    when we are building applications.
    Now, you can think of the octopus as the thing that holds things together, but
    also keeps them separate enough to allow changes in individual pieces without
    the rest.
    In other words, I can change my view here without disturbing my model.
    Or I can change the way I'm storing my data without disturbing my
    view over here.
    
## Refractor work:

> So, refactoring is the process by which you take a piece of code and make
> it more readable and more maintainable without changing its functionality.
> So that means, you might want to break up large functions, or complicated
> functions without change the way that they're accessed by the outside 
> world or the other components of your application.
> 
> It increases  readability, maintain ability and easy work with your code
> without change how the code works.
